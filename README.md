## Snail Actions

Execute commands, with buttons and widgets from the system tray. 

There are some commands that I use constantly, but got tired to type. Especially the ones with parameters, for instance, adjusting screen brightness, are tedious to execute by hand.

The configuration is saved in the config folder for "snail-actions", exact location depending on the OS (e.g. `$HOME/.config/snail-actions on Linux`).
